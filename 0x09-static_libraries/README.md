## C - Static libraries
This project I covered the concept of  C-Static Libraries where I covered:
- What a static libray is, how it works, how to create one, and how to use it.
- Basic usage of ar,ranlib, nm

### Tasks

1) Create the static library libmy.a containing all my functions 
2) Create a script called create_static_lib.sh that creates a static library called liball.a from all the .c files that are in the current directory.

### Files
a) libmy.a: contains my functions from the alx-low-level programming in C
b) main.h: contains allthe prototypes of my functions
c) create_static_lib.sh: creates a static library called liball.a from all the .c files that are in the current directory
